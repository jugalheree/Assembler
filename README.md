# Assembler — From Idea to Execution

## 📌 Overview

Assembler is a city-based “cluster + marketplace” platform that helps electronics and hardware startups assemble execution-ready teams in their own city.

The platform guides founders from idea to action by structuring their needs, recommending the right execution model, and enabling high-trust connections with verified clusters and experts.

This project was created as part of the Dignifiedme Technologies UI/UX weekend challenge.

## 🧠 How the Platform Works

Idea input → Stage & execution needs → City selection → Explore clusters & individuals → View verified details → Book intro call → Confirmation

Assembler focuses on **guided decision-making**, not just talent discovery.
